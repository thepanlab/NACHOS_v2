# NACHOS algorithms

NACHOS(Nested and Automated Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Optimization using Supercomputing) integrates Nested Cross-Validation (NCV), Automated HyperParameter Optimization (HPO), and High-Performance Computing (HPC) to have a better estimation of the generalization error with uncertainty quantification. More details can be found in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08589).
